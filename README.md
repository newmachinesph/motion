# Prompt Studio

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green) ![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/React-19-61dafb) ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-blue) ![Vite](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vite-8-646cff) ![Tailwind](https://img.shields.io/badge/Tailwind-4-38bdf8)

A dynamic frontend for turning a website brief into a coherent, build-ready prompt for Framer, coding agents, visual builders, Figma, Webflow, or plain HTML/CSS.

## Run it

On Windows, double-click `start.bat` or run:

```powershell
.\start.bat
```

This launcher uses `npm.cmd`, so it also works when PowerShell blocks the `npm.ps1` shim.

Alternatively:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

From a PowerShell session with restricted script execution, use:

```powershell
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` after the server starts.

Production checks:

```bash
npm run verify
npm run typecheck
npm run build
```

Ten-site calibration run:

```bash
npm run benchmark
npm run benchmark:qa
```

The benchmark generates ten real responsive sites and their prompts in `C:\Users\Developer\Desktop\projects\prompt-studio-benchmark`, then captures desktop/mobile viewport evidence and checks identity, purpose, CTA fit, overflow, missing media and console errors.

Multi-page SaaS calibration:

```bash
npm run benchmark:saas
npm run benchmark:saas:qa
```

This generates seven separately addressable Rivetline routes in `C:\Users\Developer\Desktop\projects\rivetline-saas`, using a Codex Images logo directly without vector tracing. QA renders every route at desktop and mobile sizes, crawls internal links and exercises pricing, filtering and form states.

## What it does

- Routes 11 website species into different content and section architectures.
- Captures audience, network, accessibility, locale, brand traits and anti-goals.
- Requires reference intent—what to borrow, adapt or avoid—rather than accepting unbounded mood links.
- Recommends motion from the subject and delivery constraints.
- Runs a traditional studio model with accountable strategy, creative direction, art direction, UX, identity, type, content, interaction, systems, critique and design-engineering roles.
- Commissions three to five independent creative territories and applies a six-axis similarity veto across topology, typography, palette/value, image language, shape grammar and motion logic.
- Requires written critiques, a decision log, art-direction studies and approved desktop/interior/mobile/state keyframes before implementation can begin.
- Generates seeded creative directions with direction-owned grids and shape systems instead of one universal 12-column template.
- Creates a subject-specific logo strategy with a choice between original Codex Images output or editable vector construction, responsive lockups, usage rules and an identity swap test.
- For multi-page mode, requires a route manifest with a path, page job and unique payload for every route; generates template-depth, navigation, journey and link-crawl contracts.
- Lets users lock color, type, composition or motion and reroll the rest.
- Compiles target-specific prompts for six receiving tools.
- Autosaves locally and imports/exports reusable JSON briefs.
- Exports a complete `PROMPT.md` with opening-viewport budgets, website-specific asset plans, singular motion hierarchy, tokens, content, responsive, accessibility, performance and acceptance checks.

## Architecture

- `src/lib/types.ts` — shared project and direction schema.
- `src/lib/data.ts` — site types, conditional section sets, mechanic contracts, palettes and typography systems.
- `src/lib/generator.ts` — recommendations, seeded art direction, lock-aware rerolling, quality gates and prompt compilation.
- `src/App.tsx` — eight-stage product flow and persistence, including the project-room operating model.
- `src/components/` — form controls, stage navigation, direction controls and live prompt preview.
- `scripts/verify-generator.ts` — cross-category compiler verification.
- `scripts/run-benchmark.ts` and `scripts/benchmark/` — ten-category builds, logo SVGs, visual rubric and responsive browser QA.
- `scripts/run-saas-multipage.ts` and `scripts/saas-multipage/` — seven-route SaaS build, untraced Codex Image identity and cross-route interaction QA.
